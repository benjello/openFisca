To build the documentation run the python script make.py (stolen from pandas).
It builds both the english (en) and french (fr) html documentation.
 
.rst files are the doc files processed according to the conf.py file.
html files are in the _build directory.

TODO : make the docs more usable for both the users and the developpers 
       following for example what pandas does
